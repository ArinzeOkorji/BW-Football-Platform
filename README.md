Why Angular? Well, Angular is the framework I have been growing my skills with. It was an opportunity to showcase what I'd learned so for on a project like this.

## Duration
It took me 8 days to build this product

## Challenges faced
Dealing with font icons was a hassle for me because I did not want use a cdn

## What I loved
The fact  I was able to produce a product to this level is still exciting for me. Also, learning how to manipulate ngx-pagination, and using an interceptor service to use a single header to my http calls was like icing on the cake.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.9.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
